**Uthaan: Cooperative Blockchain Procurement Network**

## Overview

Uthaan is a blockchain-powered procurement platform designed to connect farmers, Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS), and NABARD on a secure, permissioned ledger. By automating key steps from delivery to payment, Uthaan accelerates cash flows, eliminates disputes, and provides real-time analytics to all stakeholders.

## Key Features

* **Permissioned Blockchain**: Records each lot-ID, weight, and quality grade at the first weigh-bridge for an immutable, auditable trail.
* **Gov-Ready APIs**: Seamlessly integrates with NABARD’s Common PACS ERP and AgriStack to eliminate data duplication and satisfy audit requirements.
* **Mobile App for Farmers**: Bilingual UI (Hindi & Punjabi) with QR code receipts for full visibility into dues and transaction history.
* **Policy Fit**:

  * **PACS Computerisation**: 50,455 societies onboard NABARD’s ERP (₹2,516 Cr) ready for a blockchain layer.
  * **Digital Agriculture Mission / AgriStack**: Leverages India’s digital public infrastructure for farm data.
  * **e-Procurement Push**: 6.4M farmers transact via Nafed/NCCF portals; Uthaan adds cryptographic trust.

## How It Works (4 Steps)

1. **Register**: Auto-sync Farmer/PACS IDs from AgriStack.
2. **Deliver**: Weigh grain; IoT moisture meter logs quality.
3. **Record**: Data hash + digital signature appended to the blockchain.
4. **Verify**: Immutable records ensure transparent, tamper-proof transactions.

## Stakeholder Benefits

* **Farmers**: Faster payments (<72 hrs), dispute-free proof of delivery.
* **PACS**: Unified dashboard for stocks, payments, and audits.
* **NABARD / FCI**: Real-time procurement analytics and fraud-proof records.
* **Consumers**: Transparent provenance enabling future retail traceability.

## Pilot & Metrics

* **Target Districts**: 25 PACS across Punjab & Himachal.
* **Throughput Goal**: 50,000 MT paddy in KMS 2025–26.
* **KPI Targets**:

  * Payment cycle under 72 hours.
  * Dispute rate under 0.5%.
  * Administrative cost savings of 10%.
